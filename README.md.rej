+* :star: [Alpha] Starting from Kubeflow Pipelines 1.7, try out [Emissary Executor](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/components/pipelines/installation/choose-executor/#emissary-executor). Emissary executor is Container runtime agnostic meaning you are able to run Kubeflow Pipelines on Kubernetes cluster with any [Container runtimes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/). The default Docker executor depends on Docker container runtime, which will be deprecated on Kubernetes 1.20+.
