# Kubeflow Pipelines with Tekton

Project to bring Kubeflow Pipelines and Tekton together. The project is split in phases and driven according to this [design doc](http://bit.ly/kfp-tekton). The current code allows you run Kubeflow Pipelines with Tekton backend end to end.

* Create your Pipeline using Kubeflow Pipelines DSL, and compile it to Tekton YAML. 
* Upload the compiled Tekton YAML to KFP engine (API and UI), and run end to end with logging and artifacts tracking enabled.

## Tekton

The Tekton Pipelines project provides Kubernetes-style resources for declaring CI/CD-style pipelines. Tekton introduces
several new CRDs including Task, Pipeline, TaskRun, and PipelineRun. A PipelineRun represents a single running instance
of a Pipeline and is responsible for creating a Pod for each of its Tasks and as many containers within each Pod as it
has Steps. Please look for more details in [Tekton repo](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline).

## Kubeflow Pipeline with Tekton backend

We are currently using [Kubeflow Pipelines 0.5.1](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/releases/tag/0.5.1) and
[Tekton 0.14.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.14.0) for this project.
