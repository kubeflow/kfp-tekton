# This script checks whether any of the files related to the backend docker 
# build (files listed in files_to_check) have been modified from the 
# origin/master branch. This is done by running a diff on each file between the 
# most recent commit on origin/master and HEAD.
#
# Execute from top-level directory i.e. kfp-tekton/
#
# If no changes were detected, return exit code 0.
# If any changes were detected in any of the files, return exit code
# DIFF_DETECTED_ERR_CODE.
# If runtime error occurs, script should fail and return error code.
