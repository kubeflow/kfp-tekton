## Development Prerequisites

1. [`Python`](https://www.python.org/downloads/): version `3.7` or later (new code must maintain compatibility with `3.7`)
2. [`Kubernetes` Cluster](https://kubernetes.io/): version `1.22` ([required by Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/kubeflow-overview/) and Tekton `0.38.4`)
3. [`kubectl` CLI](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/): required to deploy Tekton pipelines to Kubernetes cluster
4. [`Tekton` Deployment](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.38.4/): version `0.38.4` or greater, required for end-to-end testing
5. [`tkn` CLI](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli#installing-tkn): version `0.17.2` or greater, required for end-to-end testing of Tekton pipelines
6. [`Kubeflow Pipelines` Deployment](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/installation/overview/): required for some end-to-end tests


### Installing Tekton

A working Tekton cluster deployment is required to perform end-to-end tests of the pipelines generated
by the `kfp_tekton` compiler. The Tekton CLI is useful to start a pipeline and analyze the pipeline logs.

#### Tekton Cluster

Follow the instructions listed [here](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/v0.27.0/docs/install.md#installing-tekton-pipelines-on-kubernetes)
or simply run:

    kubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/tekton-releases/pipeline/previous/v0.27.0/release.yaml

**Note**, if your container runtime does not support `image-reference:tag@digest` (like cri-o used in OpenShift 4.x),
use `release.notags.yaml` instead.

**Note**, for KFP, we shouldn't modify the default work directory for any component. Therefore, please run the following
command to disable the [home and work directory overwrite](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/install.md#customizing-the-pipelines-controller-behavior) from Tekton default.

    kubectl patch cm feature-flags -n tekton-pipelines \
        -p '{"data":{"disable-home-env-overwrite":"true","disable-working-directory-overwrite":"true"}}'

Optionally, for convenience, set the default namespace to `tekton-pipelines`:

    kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=tekton-pipelines

In order to utilize the latest features and functions of the `kfp-tekton` compiler,
it may be necessary to install Tekton from a nightly built or to build it from the
[master](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md#install-pipeline)
branch. Currently there are no features that require a special build.


#### Tekton CLI

Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli#installing-tkn).

Mac OS users can install the Tekton CLI using the `homebrew` formula:

    brew tap tektoncd/tools
    brew install tektoncd/tools/tektoncd-cli

#### Tekton Dashboard

Follow the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/tektoncd/dashboard/blob/master/docs/install.md), i.e.:

    kubectl apply --filename https://github.com/tektoncd/dashboard/releases/download/v0.13.0/tekton-dashboard-release.yaml

The Tekton Dashboard can be accessed through its `ClusterIP` service by running `kubectl proxy` or the service can
be patched to expose a public `NodePort` IP:

  	kubectl patch svc tekton-dashboard -n tekton-pipelines --type='json' -p '[{"op":"replace","path":"/spec/type","value":"NodePort"}]'

To open the dashboard run:

    TKN_DASHBOARD_SVC_PORT=$(kubectl -n tekton-pipelines get service tekton-dashboard -o jsonpath='{.spec.ports[0].nodePort}')
    PUBLIC_IP=$(kubectl get nodes -o jsonpath='{.items[0].status.addresses[?(@.type=="ExternalIP")].address}')
    open "http://${PUBLIC_IP}:${TKN_DASHBOARD_SVC_PORT}/#/pipelineruns"


## Origins of the KFP-Tekton Compiler Code

The source code of the `kfp-tekton` compiler was created as an extension of the [`Kubeflow Pipelines SDK Compiler`](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/sdk/release-1.8/sdk/python/kfp/compiler).
This approach allowed us to leverage much of the existing [Kubeflow Pipelines Python SDK code](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/sdk/sdk-overview/#sdk-packages),
like the DSL and components packages, but "override" or "replace" those parts of the compiler code required to generate
the Tekton YAML instead of Argo YAML. Since the KFP SDK was not designed and implemented to easily be extended,
_monkey-patching_ was used to replace non-class methods and functions at runtime.

In order for the _monkey patch_ to work properly, the `kfp-tekton` compiler source code has to be aligned with a
specific version of the `kfp` SDK compiler. As of now the `kfp-tekton` SDK version is `1.4.0` which is aligned with KFP
SDK version [`1.8.14`](https://pypi.org/project/kfp/1.8.14/).


## Adding New Code

The Python package structure as well as the module names and method signatures closely mirror those of the
[`Kubeflow Pipelines Python SDK`](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/sdk/python).
This helps keeping track of all the code that had to modified and will make merging (some of) the code back into KFP or
identify pieces of code that need to be refactored in KFP in order to accommodate various execution platforms.
When it is necessary to bring further methods from `kfp` compiler package into the `kfp-tekton` compiler package, keep
the original method names and signatures as well as their position inside their respective Python modules.

Be sure to run `make verify` before committing your code changes and creating a pull request:

    $ make verify

    check_license: OK
    lint: OK
    unit_test: OK
    report: OK
    verify: OK


### Overriding KFP Compiler Methods

Most of the functions provided by the `kfp.compiler.compiler.Compiler` are instance based and can be overridden in
[`kfp_tekton.compiler.compiler.TektonCompiler`](/sdk/python/kfp_tekton/compiler/compiler.py).

Static `Compiler` methods may need to be also be added to the _monkey patch_ described in the next
section unless they are only used by other methods that are already overridden in `TektonCompiler`.
Be careful not to mix inheritance and monkey patching. A method which in its body calls on its
`super().` implementation must not be added to the list of methods that get dynamically replaced
via the _monkey patch_.

### Dynamically Replacing Static KFP Compiler Methods (Monkey-Patching)

When code changes are required to static helper methods in `kfp.compiler` the "overridden" methods
should be added to their respective modules in `kfp_tekton.compiler` and added to the _monkey patch_
which dynamically replaces the code in the `kfp` at runtime.

As of May 2020, the _monkey patch_ was no longer needed and removed since all of the _patched_ methods
are now invoked directly (and exclusively) by other code implemented in the `kfp_tekton` compiler.
Details on how to implement a _monkey patch_ can be found in the
[Removed Features](#monkey-patch-to-dynamically-replace-static-kfp-compiler-methods)
section if it becomes necessary to reintroduce the _monkey patch_ for any methods we need to "override"
which are not exclusively called directly by other methods we already implemented in the `kfp_tekton`
compiler.


## Coding Style

The Python code in this project follows the [Google Python style guide](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).
You can make use of a [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf) configuration file to auto-format Python code and adopt the
Google Python style. We encouraged to lint Python docstrings using [docformatter](https://github.com/myint/docformatter).
Our CI/CD integration with Travis uses [Flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/) and the current set of enforced rules
can be found in [Makefile](/Makefile):

```Makefile
.PHONY: lint
lint: venv ## Check Python code style compliance
	@which flake8 > /dev/null || pip install flake8
	flake8 sdk/python --count --show-source --statistics \
		--select=E9,E2,E3,E5,F63,F7,F82,F4,F841,W291,W292 \
		--per-file-ignores sdk/python/tests/compiler/testdata/*:F841 \
 		--max-line-length=140  && echo OK
```

Make sure to run `make lint` before you create a pull request (PR) that includes changes to Python source files.


## Testing

Before committing code changes to the compiler make sure to run the [compiler unit tests](/sdk/python/tests/compiler/compiler_tests.py):

Ideally, whenever a code change to the compiler results in modified YAML, an end-to-end test should be
run on a Tekton cluster.

### Unit Tests

Any new functionality being added to the `kfp_tekton.compiler` should be accompanied by a new unit test in `sdk/python/tests/compiler/compiler_tests.py`
Typically a test case comes with a minimal Python DSL script and a "golden" YAML file in `sdk/python/tests/compiler/testdata`.
The "golden" YAML file contains the expected compiler output. The unit tests use the "golden" YAML files to compare
the current compiler output with the previously expected compiler output.

    make unit_test


If the pipeline script compiles but does not match the "golden" YAML, then the unit test should fail.
If the change in the output YAML is desired, then the "golden" YAML needs to be regenerated, i.e. by
temporarily enabling the `GENERATE_GOLDEN_YAML` flag in `compiler_tests.py`, or by using the
environment variable:

    make test GENERATE_GOLDEN_YAML="True"


### End-to-End Tests with Tekton

The unit tests are designed to verify the YAML produced by the compiler matches the expected, previously generated
"golden" YAML. End-to-end (E2E) tests are necessary to verify that the generated Tekton YAML is syntactically valid and
that the pipeline can be executed successfully on a Tekton cluster.

A manual E2E test can be performed in the following manner:

    kubectl apply -f <pipeline.yaml>
    tkn pipeline start <pipeline-name> --showlog

Some E2E tests require a Kubernetes cluster with Kubeflow Pipelines installed in order to make use of the
artifact storage provided by [Minio](https://docs.minio.io/) and need to run in the `kubeflow` namespace in order to
access secrets:

    kubectl apply -f <pipeline.yaml> -n kubeflow
    tkn pipeline start <pipeline-name> --showlog -n kubeflow

You can also run the dynamically generated end-to-end test suite which takes all of the "golden" YAML files from the
compiler `testdata` directory and runs them on a Kubernetes cluster, prerequisite that the environment variable
`KUBECONFIG` is set and the K8s cluster has both Kubeflow Pipelines and Tekton Pipelines installed:

    make e2e_test

After adding new E2E test case or after modifying existing ones, regenerate the "golden" log files:

    make e2e_test GENERATE_GOLDEN_E2E_LOGS=True


### Compiler Test Report

The goal of the first phase of the KFP-Tekton project was to ensure that most or all of the KFP compiler features are
working for Tekton. That is, the `kfp_tekton` compiler can compile all Python DSL test scripts in the KFP compiler
[`testdata`](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/tree/master/sdk/python/tests/compiler/testdata) folder.

To update the ["Compiler Status Report"](/sdk/python/tests/README.md) use the output of this command:

    make report

## Removed Features

### Monkey-Patch to Dynamically Replace Static KFP Compiler Methods

As of May 2020, the _monkey patch_ was no longer needed and removed since all of the _patched_ methods were
now invoked directly (and exclusively) by other code implemented in the `kfp_tekton` compiler. However it may become
necessary again in the future to reintroduce the _monkey patch_ for any methods we need to "override" which are not
exclusively called directly by other methods we already implemented in the `kfp_tekton` compiler.

`sdk/python/kfp_tekton/compiler/__init__.py`:
```Python
def monkey_patch():
    """
    Overriding (replacing) selected methods/function in the KFP SDK compiler package.
    This is a temporary hack during early development of the KFP-Tekton compiler.
    """
    import kfp
    from kfp.compiler._data_passing_rewriter import fix_big_data_passing
    from kfp.compiler._k8s_helper import convert_k8s_obj_to_json
    from kfp.compiler._op_to_template import _op_to_template, _process_base_ops
    from kfp.compiler.compiler import Compiler as KFPCompiler

    from ._data_passing_rewriter import fix_big_data_passing as tekton_fix_big_data_passing
    from ._k8s_helper import convert_k8s_obj_to_json as tekton_convert_k8s_obj_to_json
    from ._op_to_template import _op_to_template as tekton_op_to_template
    from ._op_to_template import _process_base_ops as tekton_process_base_ops
    from .compiler import TektonCompiler

    kfp.compiler._data_passing_rewriter.fix_big_data_passing = tekton_fix_big_data_passing
    kfp.compiler._k8s_helper.convert_k8s_obj_to_json = tekton_convert_k8s_obj_to_json
    kfp.compiler._op_to_template._op_to_template = tekton_op_to_template
    kfp.compiler._op_to_template._process_base_ops = tekton_process_base_ops
    KFPCompiler._resolve_value_or_reference = TektonCompiler._resolve_value_or_reference
    KFPCompiler._create_dag_templates = TektonCompiler._create_dag_templates
    KFPCompiler._create_and_write_workflow = TektonCompiler._create_and_write_workflow
    KFPCompiler._create_pipeline_workflow = TektonCompiler._create_pipeline_workflow
    KFPCompiler._create_workflow = TektonCompiler._create_workflow
    KFPCompiler._group_to_dag_template = TektonCompiler._group_to_dag_template
    KFPCompiler._write_workflow = TektonCompiler._write_workflow

try:
    print("Applying KFP-Tekton compiler patch")
    monkey_patch()

except Exception as error:
    traceback.print_exc()
    print("Failed to apply KFP-Tekton compiler patch")
    sys.exit(1)
```

**Note**: Since the _monkey patch_ gets triggered by importing any member of the `kfp_tekton.compiler` module, we try to
avoid using top-level imports of any members in `kfp_tekton.compiler` in pipeline DSL scripts.
Instead use local imports to avoid triggering the _monkey-patch_ when the original KFP compiler is used to compile a
pipeline DSL script using KFP's `dsl-compile --py <DSL script>` command.

```Python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    # don't use top-level import of TektonCompiler to prevent monkey-patching KFP compiler when using KFP's dsl-compile
    from kfp_tekton.compiler import TektonCompiler
    TektonCompiler().compile(pipeline_func, __file__.replace('.py', '.yaml'))
```
