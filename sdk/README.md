# Compiler for Tekton

The Kubeflow Pipelines [SDK](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/sdk/sdk-overview/) 
allows data scientists to define end-to-end machine learning and data pipelines.
The output of the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK compiler is YAML for [Argo](https://github.com/argoproj/argo).
We are extending the compiler of the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK to generate YAML
for [Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline).

## Project Prerequisites

 - Python: `3.7.5`
 - Kubeflow Pipelines: [`0.5.1`](https://github.com/kubeflow/pipelines/releases/tag/0.5.1)
 - Tekton: [`0.13.0`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.13.0)
 - Tekton CLI: [`0.8.0`](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/releases/tag/v0.8.0)

Follow the instructions for [installing project prerequisites](/sdk/python/README.md#development-prerequisites)
and take note of some important caveats.


## Tested Pipelines

We are [testing the compiler](/sdk/python/tests/README.md) on more than 80 pipelines
found in the Kubeflow Pipelines repository, specifically the pipelines in KFP compiler
`testdata` folder, the KFP core samples and the samples contributed by third parties.

A report card of Kubeflow Pipelines samples that are currently supported by the `kfp-tekton`
compiler can be found [here](/sdk/python/tests/test_kfp_samples_report.txt).
If you work on a PR that enables another of the missing features please ensure that
your code changes are improving the number of successfully compiled KFP pipeline samples.


## How to use the KFP-Tekton Compiler

### Installation

You can install the latest release of the `kfp-tekton` compiler from
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/kfp-tekton/). We recommend to create a Python
virtual environment first:

    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    
    pip install kfp-tekton
    
Alternatively you can install the latest version of the `kfp-tekton` compiler
from source by cloning the repository [https://github.com/kubeflow/kfp-tekton](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfp-tekton):

1. Clone the `kfp-tekton` repo:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kubeflow/kfp-tekton.git
   cd kfp-tekton
   ```

2. Setup Python environment with Conda or a Python virtual environment:

   ```
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Build the compiler:

   ```
   pip install -e sdk/python
   ```

4. Run the compiler tests (optional):

   ```
   make test
   ```


### Compiling a Kubeflow Pipelines DSL Script

The `kfp-tekton` Python package comes with the `dsl-compile-tekton` command line
executable, which should be available in your terminal shell environment after
installing the `kfp-tekton` Python package.

If you cloned the `kfp-tekton` project, you can find example pipelines in the
`samples` folder or under `sdk/python/tests/compiler/testdata` folder.

    dsl-compile-tekton \
        --py sdk/python/tests/compiler/testdata/parallel_join.py \
        --output pipeline.yaml


### Running the Pipeline on a Tekton Cluster

After compiling the `sdk/python/tests/compiler/testdata/parallel_join.py` DSL script
in the step above, we need to deploy the generated Tekton YAML to our Kubernetes
cluster with `kubectl` and start a pipeline run with `tkn`:

    kubectl apply -f pipeline.yaml
    tkn pipeline start parallel-pipeline --showlog

A prompt should be asking for the pipeline arguments. Press `enter` and
accept the defaults:

    ? Value for param `url1` of type `string`? (Default is `gs://ml-pipeline-playground/shakespeare1.txt`) gs://ml-pipeline-playground/shakespeare1.txt
    ? Value for param `url2` of type `string`? (Default is `gs://ml-pipeline-playground/shakespeare2.txt`) gs://ml-pipeline-playground/shakespeare2.txt
    
    Pipelinerun started: parallel-pipeline-run-th4x6
   
Once the Tekton Pipeline is running, the logs should start streaming:
      
    Waiting for logs to be available...
    
    [gcs-download-2 : gcs-download-2] I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited And more than may be gatherd by thy shape Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath
    [gcs-download : gcs-download] With which he yoketh your rebellious necks Razeth your cities and subverts your towns And in a moment makes them desolate
    [echo : echo] Text 1: With which he yoketh your rebellious necks Razeth your cities and subverts your towns And in a moment makes them desolate
    [echo : echo] Text 2: I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited And more than may be gatherd by thy shape Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath

      
## Build Tekton from Master

In order to utilize the latest features and functions of the `kfp-tekton` compiler,
we suggest to install Tekton from a nightly built or build it from the
[master](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md#install-pipeline)
branch. Features that require a special build, different from the 'Tested Version',
will be listed below.

## Additional Features

### 1. Compile Kubeflow Pipelines as a Tekton PipelineRun

By default, a Tekton [`PipelineRun`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/pipelineruns.md#overview)
is generated by the `tkn` CLI so that users can interactively change their pipeline
parameters during each execution. 
However, `tkn` CLI is lagging several important features when generating a `PipelineRun`.
Therefore, we added support for generating pipelineRun using `dsl-compile-tekton`
with all the latest `kfp-tekton` compiler features. The comparison between Tekton
pipeline and Argo workflow is described in our 
[design docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oXOdiItI4GbEe_qzyBmMAqfLBjfYX1nM94WHY3EPa94/edit#heading=h.f38y0bqkxo87).

Compiling Kubeflow Pipelines into a Tekton `PipelineRun` is currently in the experimental
stage. [Here](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/pipelineruns.md) is
the list of supported features in `PipelineRun`.

As of today, the below `PipelineRun` features are available within `dsl-compile-tekton`:
 - Affinity
 - Node Selector
 - Tolerations

To compile Kubeflow Pipelines as Tekton pipelineRun, add the `--generate-pipelinerun`
parameter to the `dsl-compile-tekton` command:

    dsl-compile-tekton \
        --py sdk/python/tests/compiler/testdata/tolerations.py \
        --output pipeline.yaml \
        --generate-pipelinerun


### 2. Compile Kubeflow Pipelines with Artifacts Enabled

**Prerequisites**: Install [Kubeflow Pipelines](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/installation/).

By default, _artifacts_ are disabled because they are dependent on Kubeflow Pipeline's
[Minio](https://docs.minio.io/) storage. When artifacts are enabled, all the output
parameters are also treated as artifacts and persisted to the default object storage.
Enabling artifacts also allows files to be downloaded or stored as artifact inputs/outputs.
Since artifacts are dependent on the Kubeflow Pipeline's deployment, the generated
Tekton pipeline must be deployed to the same namespace as Kubeflow Pipelines.

To compile Kubeflow Pipelines as a Tekton `PipelineRun`, add the `--enable-artifacts`
argument to your `dsl-compile-tekton` commands. Then, run the pipeline in the same
namespace that is used by Kubeflow Pipelines (typically `kubeflow`) by using the
`-n` flag. e.g.:

    dsl-compile-tekton \
        --py sdk/python/tests/compiler/testdata/parallel_join.py \
        --output pipeline.yaml \
        --enable-artifacts
        
    kubectl apply -f pipeline.yaml -n kubeflow
    
    tkn pipeline start parallel-pipeline --showlog -n kubeflow


You should see log messages saying the artifacts were stored in the object storage you specified:

    ? Value for param `url1` of type `string`? (Default is `gs://ml-pipeline-playground/shakespeare1.txt`) gs://ml-pipeline-playground/shakespeare1.txt
    ? Value for param `url2` of type `string`? (Default is `gs://ml-pipeline-playground/shakespeare2.txt`) gs://ml-pipeline-playground/shakespeare2.txt

## Troubleshooting

- When you encounter permission issues related to ServiceAccount, refer to
  [Servince Account and RBAC doc](sa-and-rbac.md)
  
- If you run into `bad interpreter: No such file or director` when trying to use
  python's venv, remove the current virtual environment in the `.venv` directory and
  create a new one using `virtualenv .venv`
