# Kubeflow Pipelines SDK for Tekton

The Kubeflow Pipelines [SDK](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/sdk/sdk-overview/)
allows data scientists to define end-to-end machine learning and data pipelines.
The output of the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK compiler is YAML for [Argo](https://github.com/argoproj/argo).

The `kfp-tekton` SDK is extending the `Compiler` and the `Client` of the Kubeflow
Pipelines SDK to generate [Tekton](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) YAML
and to subsequently upload and run the pipeline with the Kubeflow Pipelines engine
backed by Tekton.

## Extensions to the Kubeflow Pipelines SDK

In addition to the functionality provided by the Kubeflow Pipelines
[SDK](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/sdk/sdk-overview/) the `kfp-tekton`
SDK provides a `TektonCompiler` and a `TektonClient`:

`TektonCompiler`:

 - `kfp_tekton.compiler.TektonCompiler.compile` compiles Python DSL code into a 
   YAML file containing a Tekton `PipelineRun` which can be deployed directly to
   a Tekton enabled Kubernetes cluster or uploaded to the Kubeflow Pipelines
   dashboard with the Tekton backend.
   
`TektonClient`:

 - `kfp_tekton.TektonClient.create_run_from_pipeline_func` compiles DSL pipeline
   function and runs the pipeline on a Kubernetes cluster with KFP and Tekton


## Project Prerequisites

 - Python: `3.5.3` or later
 - Tekton: [`v0.14.0`](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.14.0) or [later](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/latest)
 - Tekton CLI: [`0.11.0`](https://github.com/tektoncd/cli/releases/tag/v0.11.0)
 - Kubeflow Pipelines: [KFP with Tekton backend](/tekton_kfp_guide.md)

Follow the instructions for [installing project prerequisites](/sdk/python/README.md#development-prerequisites)
and take note of some important caveats.


## Installation

You can install the latest release of the `kfp-tekton` compiler from
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/kfp-tekton/). We recommend to create a Python
virtual environment first:

    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    
    pip install kfp-tekton
    
Alternatively you can install the latest version of the `kfp-tekton` compiler
from source by cloning the repository [https://github.com/kubeflow/kfp-tekton](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfp-tekton):

1. Clone the `kfp-tekton` repo:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/kubeflow/kfp-tekton.git
   cd kfp-tekton
   ```

2. Setup Python environment with Conda or a Python virtual environment:

   ```
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Build the compiler:

   ```
   pip install -e sdk/python
   ```

4. Run the compiler tests (optional):

   ```
   pip install pytest
   make test
   ```

## Compiling a Kubeflow Pipelines DSL Script

The `kfp-tekton` Python package comes with the `dsl-compile-tekton` command line
executable, which should be available in your terminal shell environment after
installing the `kfp-tekton` Python package.

If you cloned the `kfp-tekton` project, you can find example pipelines in the
`samples` folder or under `sdk/python/tests/compiler/testdata` folder.

    dsl-compile-tekton \
        --py sdk/python/tests/compiler/testdata/parallel_join.py \
        --output pipeline.yaml


**Note**: If the KFP DSL script contains a `__main__` method calling the
`kfp_tekton.compiler.TektonCompiler.compile()` function:

```Python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    from kfp_tekton.compiler import TektonCompiler
    TektonCompiler().compile(pipeline_func, "pipeline.yaml")
```

... then the pipeline can be compiled by running the DSL script with `python3`
executable from a command line shell, producing a Tekton YAML file `pipeline.yaml`
in the same directory:

    python3 pipeline.py


## Running the Compiled Pipeline on a Tekton Cluster

After compiling the `sdk/python/tests/compiler/testdata/parallel_join.py` DSL script
in the step above, we need to deploy the generated Tekton YAML to our Kubernetes
cluster with `kubectl`. The Tekton server will automatically start a pipeline run.
We can then follow the logs using the `tkn` CLI.

    kubectl apply -f pipeline.yaml
    
    tkn pipelinerun logs --last --follow

Once the Tekton Pipeline is running, the logs should start streaming:
      
    Waiting for logs to be available...

    [gcs-download-2 : main] I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited And more than may be gatherd by thy shape Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath

    [echo : main] Text 1: With which he yoketh your rebellious necks Razeth your cities and subverts your towns And in a moment makes them desolate
    [echo : main]
    [echo : main] Text 2: I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited And more than may be gatherd by thy shape Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath
    [echo : main]


## List of Available Features

To understand how each feature is implemented and its current status, please visit
the [FEATURES](FEATURES.md) doc.


## Tested Pipelines

We are [testing the compiler](/sdk/python/tests/README.md) on more than 80 pipelines
found in the Kubeflow Pipelines repository, specifically the pipelines in KFP compiler
`testdata` folder, the KFP core samples and the samples contributed by third parties.

A report card of Kubeflow Pipelines samples that are currently supported by the `kfp-tekton`
compiler can be found [here](/sdk/python/tests/test_kfp_samples_report.txt).
If you work on a PR that enables another of the missing features please ensure that
your code changes are improving the number of successfully compiled KFP pipeline samples.


## Troubleshooting

- When you encounter ServiceAccount related permission issues, refer to the
  ["Servince Account and RBAC" doc](sa-and-rbac.md)
  
- If you run into the error `bad interpreter: No such file or director` when trying 
  to use Python's venv, remove the current virtual environment in the `.venv` directory
  and create a new one using `virtualenv .venv`

- For big data passing, PVs must be created manually, or dynamic volume provisioning,
  has to be enabled (https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/dynamic-provisioning).
  The PVC name has to match the PipelineRun name until
  [issue #181](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfp-tekton/issues/181) has been addressed.
