# KFP Tekton User Guide
[KFP Tekton User Guide](/samples/kfp-user-guide) is a guideline for all the possible ways on how to develop and consume Kubeflow pipeline. It's recommended to go over at least one of the methods in the user guide before heading into the KFP Tekton Samples.

# KFP Tekton Samples

Below are the list of samples that are currently running end to end taking the compiled Tekton yaml and deploying on a Tekton cluster directly. 
If you are interested more in the larger list of pipelines samples we are testing for whether they can be 'compiled to Tekton' format, please [look at the corresponding status page](/sdk/python/tests/README.md)
