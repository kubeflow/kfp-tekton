# KFP Tekton User Guide
[KFP Tekton User Guide](/samples/kfp-user-guide) is a guideline for the possible ways to develop and consume Kubeflow Pipeline with Tekton. It's recommended to go over at least one of the methods in the user guide before heading into the KFP Tekton Samples.

# KFP Tekton Samples

Below are the list of samples that are currently running end to end taking the compiled Tekton yaml and deploying on a Tekton cluster directly. 
If you are interested more in the larger list of pipelines samples we are testing for whether they can be 'compiled to Tekton' format, please [look at the corresponding status page](/sdk/python/tests/README.md)

## Prerequisites 
- Install [Kubeflow 1.0.2+](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/getting-started/) and connect the cluster to the current shell with `kubectl`
- Install [Tekton 0.14.0](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/releases/tag/v0.14.0)
    - For KFP, we shouldn't be modifying the default work directory for any component. Therefore, please run the below command to disable the [home and work directories overwrite](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/master/docs/install.md#customizing-the-pipelines-controller-behavior) from Tekton default.
        ```shell
        kubectl patch cm feature-flags -n tekton-pipelines -p '{"data":{"disable-home-env-overwrite":"true","disable-working-directory-overwrite":"true"}}'
        ```
- Install [Kubeflow pipeline with Tekton backend](/tekton_kfp_guide.md)
- Install [kfp-tekton](/sdk/README.md) SDK
    ```
    # Set up the python virtual environment
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Install the kfp-tekton SDK
    pip install kfp-tekton
    ```
