# Installing Kubeflow Pipelines with Tekton

## Prequisites

A Kubernetes cluster `v1.16` that has least 8 vCPU and 16 GB memory. 

1. Using *IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service (IKS)*:

    * Authenticating with IBM Cloud

    ```shell
    ibmcloud login
    ```

    * Accessing the IBM Cloud cluster

    If you do not have access to a cluster created with IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, follow the [Create an IBM Cloud cluster](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/ibm/create-cluster) guide to create a cluster.

    Run the following command to switch the Kubernetes context and access the cluster.

    ```shell
    ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster <cluster_name>
    ```

    Replace `<cluster_name>` with your cluster name. 
    
    Addtionally follow the instructions to setup [Block storage on IBM Cloud](#ibm-cloud-block-storage-setup)

2. Using other Cloud providers or on-prem Kubernetes deployment:
    - Visit [Kubeflow Cloud Installation](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/cloud/) for setting up the preferred environment to deploy Kubeflow.

3. Using OpenShift
    - Follow [Deploy Kubeflow Pipelines with Tekton backend on OpenShift Container Platform](https://github.com/IBM/KubeflowDojo/tree/master/OpenShift/manifests)
  
## Kubeflow installation including Kubeflow Pipelines with Tekton backend
Run the following commands to set up and deploy Kubeflow with KFP-Tekton. To understand more about the Kubeflow deployment mechanism, please read [here](#understanding-the-kubeflow-deployment-process).

1. Download the kfctl v1.1.0 release from the
  [Kubeflow releases 
  page](https://github.com/kubeflow/kfctl/releases/tag/v1.1.0).

1. Unpack the tarball
      ```
      tar -xvf kfctl_v1.1.0_<platform>.tar.gz
      ```
1. Make kfctl binary easier to use (optional). If you donâ€™t add the binary to your path, you must use the full path to the kfctl binary each time you run it.
      ```
      export PATH=$PATH:<path to where kfctl was unpacked>
      ```
    
Choose either [**single user**](#single-user) or [**multi-tenant**](#multi-user-auth-enabled) section based on your usage.

### Single user
Run the following commands to set up and deploy Kubeflow for a single user without any authentication.
```
# Set KF_NAME to the name of your Kubeflow deployment. This also becomes the
# name of the directory containing your configuration.
# For example, your deployment name can be 'my-kubeflow' or 'kf-test'.
export KF_NAME=<your choice of name for the Kubeflow deployment>

# Set the path to the base directory where you want to store one or more 
# Kubeflow deployments. For example, /opt/.
# Then set the Kubeflow application directory for this deployment.
export BASE_DIR=<path to a base directory>
export KF_DIR=${BASE_DIR}/${KF_NAME}

# Set the configuration file to use, such as the file specified below:
export CONFIG_URI="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/KubeflowDojo/master/manifests/kfctl_ibm_k8s_single_user.yaml"

# Generate and deploy Kubeflow:
mkdir -p ${KF_DIR}
cd ${KF_DIR}
kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_URI}
```

* **${KF_NAME}** - The name of your Kubeflow deployment.
  If you want a custom deployment name, specify that name here.
  For example,  `my-kubeflow` or `kf-test`.
  The value of KF_NAME must consist of lower case alphanumeric characters or
  '-', and must start and end with an alphanumeric character.
  The value of this variable cannot be greater than 25 characters. It must
  contain just a name, not a directory path.
  This value also becomes the name of the directory where your Kubeflow 
  configurations are stored, that is, the Kubeflow application directory. 

* **${KF_DIR}** - The full path to your Kubeflow application directory.

### Multi-user, auth-enabled
Run the following commands to deploy Kubeflow with GitHub OAuth application as the authentication provider by dex. To support multi-users with authentication enabled, this guide uses [dex](https://github.com/dexidp/dex) with [GitHub OAuth](https://docs.github.com/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps). Before continue, refer to the guide [Creating an OAuth App](https://docs.github.com/developers/apps/creating-an-oauth-app) for steps to create an OAuth app on GitHub.com.

The scenario is a GitHub organization owner can authorize its organization members to access a deployed kubeflow. A member of this GitHub organization will be redirected to a page to grant access to the GitHub profile by Kubeflow.

1. Create a new OAuth app in GitHub. Use following setting to register the application:
    * Homepage URL: `http://<node_pubilc_ip>:31380/`
    * Authorization callback URL: `http://<node_pubilc_ip>:31380/dex/callback`
1. Once the application is registered, copy and save the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` for use later.
1. Setup environment variables:
    ```
    export KF_NAME=<your choice of name for the Kubeflow deployment>

    # Set the path to the base directory where you want to store one or more 
    # Kubeflow deployments. For example, /opt/.
    export BASE_DIR=<path to a base directory>

    # Then set the Kubeflow application directory for this deployment.
    export KF_DIR=${BASE_DIR}/${KF_NAME}
    ```
1. Setup configuration files:
    ```
    export CONFIG_URI="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/KubeflowDojo/master/manifests/kfctl_ibm_dex_multi_user_tekton_V1.1.0.yaml"
    # Generate and deploy Kubeflow:
    mkdir -p ${KF_DIR}
    cd ${KF_DIR}
    kfctl build -V -f ${CONFIG_URI}
    ```
1. Deploy Kubeflow:
    ```
    kfctl apply -V -f ${CONFIG_URI}
    ```
1. Wait until the deployment finishes successfully. e.g., all pods are in `Running` state when running `kubectl get pod -n kubeflow`.
1. Update the configmap `dex` in namespace `auth` with credentials from the first step.
    - Get current resource file of current configmap `dex`:
    `kubectl get configmap dex -n auth -o yaml > dex-cm.yaml`
    The `dex-cm.yaml` file looks like following:
    ```YAML
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: ConfigMap
    metadata:
      name: dex
      namespace: auth
    data:
      config.yaml: |-
        issuer: http://dex.auth.svc.cluster.local:5556/dex
        storage:
          type: kubernetes
          config:
            inCluster: true
        web:
          http: 0.0.0.0:5556
        logger:
          level: "debug"
          format: text
        connectors:
          - type: github
            # Required field for connector id.
            id: github
            # Required field for connector name.
            name: GitHub
            config:
              # Fill in client ID, client Secret as string literal.
              clientID:
              clientSecret: 
              redirectURI: http://dex.auth.svc.cluster.local:5556/dex/callback
              # Optional organizations and teams, communicated through the "groups" scope.
              #
              # NOTE: This is an EXPERIMENTAL config option and will likely change.
              #
              orgs:
              # Fill in your GitHub organization name
              - name:
              # Required ONLY for GitHub Enterprise. Leave it empty when using github.com.
              # This is the Hostname of the GitHub Enterprise account listed on the
              # management console. Ensure this domain is routable on your network.
              hostName:
              # Flag which indicates that all user groups and teams should be loaded.
              loadAllGroups: false
              # flag which will switch from using the internal GitHub id to the users handle (@mention) as the user id.
              # It is possible for a user to change their own user name but it is very rare for them to do so
              useLoginAsID: false
        staticClients:
        - id: kubeflow-oidc-authservice
          redirectURIs: ["/login/oidc"]
          name: 'Dex Login Application'
          # Update the secret below to match with the oidc authservice.
          secret: pUBnBOY80SnXgjibTYM9ZWNzY2xreNGQok
    ```
    - Replace `clientID` and `clientSecret` in the `config.yaml` field with the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` created above for the GitHub OAuth application. Add your organization name to the `orgs` field, e.g.
    ```YAML
    orgs:
    - name: kubeflow-test
    ```
    Save the `dex-cm.yaml` file.
    - Update this change to the Kubernetes cluster:
    ```
    kubectl apply -f dex-cm.yaml -n auth

    # Remove this file with sensitive information.
    rm dex-cm.yaml
    ```
    
1. Apply configuration changes:
    ```
    kubectl rollout restart deploy/dex -n auth
    ```

    Then visit the Kubeflow endpoint `<node_public_ip>:31380` to login into Kubeflow

1. Visit [KFP Tekton User Guide](/samples/kfp-user-guide) and start learning how to use Kubeflow pipeline.

## Verify installation

1. Check the resources deployed correctly in namespace `kubeflow`

     ```
     kubectl get all -n kubeflow
     ```

1. Open Kubeflow Dashboard. The default installation does not create an external endpoint but you can use port-forwarding to visit your cluster. Run the following command and visit http://localhost:8080.

     ```
     kubectl port-forward svc/istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system 8080:80
     ```

In case you want to expose the Kubeflow Dashboard over an external IP, you can change the type of the ingress gateway. To do that, you can edit the service:

     kubectl edit -n istio-system svc/istio-ingressgateway

From that file, replace `type: NodePort` with `type: LoadBalancer` and save.

While the change is being applied, you can watch the service until below command prints a value under the `EXTERNAL-IP` column:

     kubectl get -w -n istio-system svc/istio-ingressgateway

The external IP should be accessible by visiting http://<EXTERNAL-IP>. Note that the above installation instructions do not create any protection for the external endpoint so it will be accessible to anyone without any authentication. 

## IBM Cloud Block Storage Setup

**Note**: This section is only required when the worker node provider `WORKER_NODE_PROVIDER` is set to `classic`. For other infrastructures, IBM Cloud Block Storage is already set up as the cluster's default storage class.

When using the `classic` worker node provider of IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster, by default, it uses [IBM Cloud File Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/file-storage) based on NFS as the default storage class. File Storage is designed to run RWX (read-write multiple nodes) workloads with proper security built around it. Therefore, File Storage [does not allow `fsGroup` securityContext](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-security#container) which is needed for DEX and Kubeflow Jupyter Server.

[IBM Cloud Block Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/block-storage) provides a fast way to store data and
satisfy many of the Kubeflow persistent volume requirements such as `fsGroup` out of the box and optimized RWO (read-write single node) which is used on all Kubeflow's persistent volume claim. 

Therefore, we strongly recommend to set up [IBM Cloud Block Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-block_storage#add_block) as the default storage class so that you can
get the best experience from Kubeflow.

1. [Follow the instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to install the Helm version 3 client on your local machine.

2. Add the IBM Cloud Helm chart repository to the cluster where you want to use the IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in.
    ```shell
    helm repo add iks-charts https://icr.io/helm/iks-charts
    helm repo update
    ```

3. Install the IBM Cloud Block Storage plug-in. When you install the plug-in, pre-defined block storage classes are added to your cluster.
    ```shell
    helm install 1.6.0 iks-charts/ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin -n kube-system
    ```
    
    Example output:
    ```
    NAME: 1.6.0
    LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Feb 27 11:41:35 2020
    NAMESPACE: kube-system
    STATUS: deployed
    REVISION: 1
    NOTES:
    Thank you for installing: ibmcloud-block-storage-plugin.   Your release is named: 1.6.0
    ...
    ```

4. Verify that the installation was successful.
    ```shell
    kubectl get pod -n kube-system | grep block
    ```
    
5. Verify that the storage classes for Block Storage were added to your cluster.
    ```
    kubectl get storageclasses | grep block
    ```

6. Set the Block Storage as the default storageclass.
    ```shell
    kubectl patch storageclass ibmc-block-gold -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'

    # Check the default storageclass is block storage
    kubectl get storageclass | grep \(default\)
    ```

    Example output:
    ```
    ibmc-block-gold (default)   ibm.io/ibmc-block   65s
    ```

    Make sure `ibmc-block-gold` is the only `default` storageclass. If there are two or more rows in the above output, there is other `default` storageclass. Unset it with the below command, for example, will make the `ibmc-file-bronze` storage no longer the `default` storageclass for the cluster.

    ```shell
    kubectl patch storageclass ibmc-file-bronze -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"false"}}}'
    ```
## Understanding the Kubeflow deployment process

The deployment process is controlled by the following commands:

* **build** - (Optional) Creates configuration files defining the various
  resources in your deployment. You only need to run `kfctl build` if you want
  to edit the resources before running `kfctl apply`.
* **apply** - Creates or updates the resources.
* **delete** - Deletes the resources.

### App layout

Your Kubeflow application directory **${KF_DIR}** contains the following files and 
directories:

* **${CONFIG_FILE}** is a YAML file that defines configurations related to your 
  Kubeflow deployment.

  * This file is a copy of the GitHub-based configuration YAML file that
    you used when deploying Kubeflow. For example, {{% config-uri-ibm %}}.
  * When you run `kfctl apply` or `kfctl build`, kfctl creates
    a local version of the configuration file, `${CONFIG_FILE}`,
    which you can further customize if necessary.

* **kustomize** is a directory that contains the kustomize packages for Kubeflow applications.
    * The directory is created when you run `kfctl build` or `kfctl apply`.
    * You can customize the Kubernetes resources (modify the manifests and run `kfctl apply` again).
    
You can find general information about Kubeflow configuration in the guide to [configuring Kubeflow with kfctl and kustomize](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/other-guides/kustomize/).
